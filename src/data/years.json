But last week, in the largest and most emotional outburst ever seen in the British colony, more than 500,000 demonstrators marched through Hong Kong's narrow streets, waving pro-democracy banners and singing anthems like We Shall Overcome. Including the spectators who cheered and applauded, an estimated 1 million people, one-sixth of Hong Kong's populace, turned out to proclaim their support for the embattled students in China.",

But Britain's sovereignty is set to run out under an Anglo-Chinese agreement reached in 1984. Now Hong Kong's residents, the vast majority of whom are descendants of refugees from the mainland, scrutinize the crisis in China for clues to the fate of the colony under Communist control.

Overseas, Hong Kong citizens contributed to the movement by providing moral and material support; in the hopes that the reunification process would be smoother if liberal reforms could be achieved in China before the handover.",
                "The inhabitants of Hong Kong usually reserve their deepest passions for business, not politics. But last week, in the largest and most emotional outburst ever seen in the British colony, more than 500,000 demonstrators marched through Hong Kong's narrow streets, waving pro-democracy banners and singing anthems like We Shall Overcome. Including the spectators who cheered and applauded, an estimated 1 million people, one-sixth of Hong Kong's populace, turned out to proclaim their support for the embattled students in China.",
                "The unprecedented outcry reflected Hong Kong's growing anxiety over its return to China in 1997. A sleek modern city on the South China Sea, Hong Kong has become a hotbed of capitalism during 147 years of British rule. But Britain's sovereignty is set to run out under an Anglo-Chinese agreement reached in 1984. Now Hong Kong's residents, the vast majority of whom are descendants of refugees from the mainland, scrutinize the crisis in China for clues to the fate of the colony under Communist control. Declared a banner that Hong Kong students carried last week: TODAY'S CHINA IS TOMORROW'S HONG KONG. (Times, Greenwald, 1989)"

In China, the past is never past, but it is frequently purged. The story is rewritten, the narrative reframed, the villains and the heroes recast. There is a hallucinatory quality to such a society, as if you are living a life that does not and never can fully belong to you.&rdquo; (Fan, The New Yorker, 2019)"
