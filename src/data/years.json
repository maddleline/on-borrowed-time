But last week, in the largest and most emotional outburst ever seen in the British colony, more than 500,000 demonstrators marched through Hong Kong's narrow streets, waving pro-democracy banners and singing anthems like We Shall Overcome. Including the spectators who cheered and applauded, an estimated 1 million people, one-sixth of Hong Kong's populace, turned out to proclaim their support for the embattled students in China.",

A sleek modern city on the South China Sea, Hong Kong has become a hotbed of capitalism during 147 years of British rule. But Britain's sovereignty is set to run out under an Anglo-Chinese agreement reached in 1984. Now Hong Kong's residents, the vast majority of whom are descendants of refugees from the mainland, scrutinize the crisis in China for clues to the fate of the colony under Communist control.
